## Code

### Inline Code

Use `backticks` for inline code, like `System.out.println("Hello, world!");` in Java.

### Code Blocks

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Greetings from the universe!";
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Earthlings")
```

```javascript
function sayHello(planet) {
  console.log("Hello, " + planet + "!");
}

sayHello("Mars");
```

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |
| Row 3, Col 1 | Row 3, Col 2 | Row 3, Col 3 |

## Blockquotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Someone, probably.

> Another quote, this time about the importance of exploration:
>> "To boldly go where no one has gone before."

## Horizontal Rule

## HTML

While generally discouraged in pure Markdown, some HTML can be used:

<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal a hidden message</summary>
  <p>This is a secret message! Shhh...</p>
</details>

<br>

This demonstrates a line break using HTML.

## Escaping Characters

To display literal characters that have special meaning in Markdown (like \*, \_, \`, etc.), you can escape them with a backslash: \*, \_, \`, \[, \], \(, \), \#, \+, \-, \., !, |, \\.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of common Markdown features. Remember to consult a specific Markdown flavor's documentation for full details and supported extensions.

This Markdown file includes a variety of elements, from headings and emphasis to code blocks in multiple languages, tables, images, and even some HTML. The content within these elements is randomized to provide a more dynamic example. This should give you a good starting point for understanding and using Markdown.
